# Brazilian Ecommerce Review Analysis

This project analyzes real-world data from Brazilian e-commerce transactions, focusing on customer reviews. The main objective is to build an **interpretable model** that explains the key factors behind positive and negative customer feedback, helping guide business decisions and service improvements.

## Data Source

The data comes from **Olist**, a Brazilian online retail platform, and includes anonymized information about customer orders, products, payments, reviews, and logistics.

## Project Overview

- The project offers a **reproducible step by step exploratory data analysis (EDA)**.
- Users may choose to **skip the EDA** and move directly to the **modeling and results** sections.
- Each section is **clearly divided and includes instructions** to ensure smooth execution.

## Key Notes

- The analysis focuses on **explainability over predictive accuracy**.
- The goal is to identify the most impactful variables on customer satisfaction.
- All results are reproducible with the provided datasets and notebook.

## Quick View

For a quick visualization, you can go directly to the `Notebook` folder and open the `Brasil_ECom.ipynb` file using GitHub's online viewer. No need to download anything.

## Future Plans

The following improvements are planned for future revisions:
- Reevaluate the actual relevance and contribution of the `Days_TA ` variable.
- Assess the benefits of transforming `Days_Early` into a binary feature instead of using it as a continuous variable.
- Explore an alternative analysis focused entirely on **product characteristics**, excluding all delivery related features.
